Pure PHP Subversion Client
==========================

This is a PHP package that implements part of the functionality of the
'svn' Subversion client (namely 'checkout' and 'update', without
merging).  It was written back in 2006 as part of the self-upgrade
process for PeopleAggregator[1].

StandaloneClient.php is pretty solid and has had very few issues since
originally being written.  Unfortunately I haven't had time to
properly extricate all this from PeopleAggregator, so you'll have to
do that yourself.

The biggest difference between this and the 'svn' client is that this
doesn't keep a pristine copy of anything, just a hash of each file.
If it detects that a file about to be patched has a different hash to
the stored value, it will either replace the file by downloading a
fresh copy of it, or simply leave the file as-is.  This isn't too bad
if you are just updating code, but take care with local modifications.
